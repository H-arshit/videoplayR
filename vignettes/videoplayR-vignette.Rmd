# Installation

## Installing `pkg-config` and `opencv`

### Mac

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
brew install pkg-config opencv3
```

### Linux 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libopencv-dev
```

### Windows

Unfortunately `videoplayR` is not (yet) available on Windows. 

I have zero experience preparing Rcpp-based packages for Windows and currently I 
do not have the time and resources to learn how to compile packages for Windows. 
If you are a R/Rcpp developer with experience preparing packages to compile on 
Windows, you can head to `videoplayR` [Github repository](https://github.com/swarm-lab/videoplayR), 
clone it and send a pull request once you have figured out how to properly 
install the package on Windows. 

## Installing `videoplayR` from Github

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("swarm-lab/videoplayR")
```
